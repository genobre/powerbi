# Power BI Portfolio
<br />

## Why did I create this portfolio?

This portfolio contains some dashboards and analyses I made for various purposes using Power BI. In each folder, you will encounter all the files and explanations necessary to replicate the results.

Some of the projects here are my resolutions to the problems proposed in the Power BI course offered by the [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/).

## What is Power BI?

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a business analytics service by Microsoft. Its purpose is to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with a simple interface for end-users to create reports and dashboards.

## What will you need to replicate the results?

You will need to use the Windows OS and have the Power BI downloaded. You can download the Power BI Desktop app for free on the [Windows Store](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).
