# Mini Project with Power Bi and google Analytics

The purpose of this mini-project is to simulate what it would be like to work with Power BI using data obtained directly from Google Analytics.

## Getting the data

As many do not have an online page from which to extract the data, we will use data from the [Google Merchandise](https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com/) Store available on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). To facilitate analysis, the [dataset](dataset.csv) used for this project can be downloaded directly from the repository.

## Problem Parameters

We are dealing with data from an e-commerce. For this project, we will answer the following questions:

1. How do customers access our portal the most, through organic or paid search?
2. How long on average does a visitor stay on our portal per day of the month?
3. What is the main source of access to our portal?
4. What is the most used operating system to access our portal?
5. What is the most used device to access our portal?
6. What is the total billing per day?
