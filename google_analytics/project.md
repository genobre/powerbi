# Mini Project with Power Bi and google Analytics

The purpose of this mini-project is to simulate what it would be like to work with Power BI using data obtained directly from Google Analytics.

## Getting the data

As many do not have an online page from which to extract the data, we will use data from the [Google Merchandise](https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com/) Store available on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). To facilitate analysis, the [dataset](dataset.csv) used for this project can be downloaded directly from the repository.
